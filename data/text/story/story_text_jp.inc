	.string "{JPN}Not only do you lack the funds to\n"

	.string "{JPN}I have one idea on how you can gather\l"
	.string "{JPN}funds for your move…\p"
	.string "{JPN}There exists a popular legend around\n"
	.string "{JPN}this area.\p"
	.string "{JPN}Let me explain.$"

OracleHill_Text_OracleLegend:
	.string "{JPN}Many, many years ago, a lowly peasant\n"
	.string "{JPN}lived in this area.\p"
	.string "{JPN}Our region was ruled by a powerful\n"
	.string "{JPN}emperor who took all that people\l"
	.string "{JPN}had and left them with mere scraps.\p"
	.string "{JPN}One day, the lowly peasant unearthed a\n"
	.string "{JPN}golden relic whilst farming the fields.\p"
	.string "{JPN}The peasant wanted to sell this relic\n"
	.string "{JPN}and move up in the world, but he had\l"
	.string "{JPN}to be wary of the emperor, who was\l"
	.string "{JPN}going to the fields later that day.\p"
	.string "{JPN}So the peasant hid the relic deep\n"
	.string "{JPN}underground, and covered the hole with\l"
	.string "{JPN}earth and leaves so that it would not\l"
	.string "{JPN}stand out.\p"
	.string "{JPN}The emperor came and went with no\n"
	.string "{JPN}incident, but when the time came to\l"
	.string "{JPN}unearth the relic, it was gone!\p"
	.string "{JPN}Unfortunately for the peasant, that is\n"
	.string "{JPN}where the story ends.\p"
	.string "{JPN}He never recovered his treasure.$"

OracleHill_Text_OracleLongShot:
	.string "{JPN}It is a long shot, but perhaps this\n"
	.string "{JPN}story is real and this golden relic\l"
	.string "{JPN}is still out there.\p"
	.string "{JPN}Apart from wishing on a shooting star,\n"
	.string "{JPN}obtaining that relic and selling it is\l"
	.string "{JPN}the only way for you to gain the wealth\l"
	.string "{JPN}you need in order to move to the city.$"

OracleHill_Text_OracleCheckRuins:
	.string "{JPN}I suggest you head to the Color Ruins\n"
	.string "{JPN}as there may be more information there.\p"
	.string "{JPN}The text in the ruins is written in an\n"
	.string "{JPN}obscure language, so please take this.$"

OracleHill_Text_OracleGuideExplain:
	.string "{JPN}That should help you decipher the\n"
	.string "{JPN}language in the Color Ruins.\p"
	.string "{JPN}I was given it years ago by an old\n"
	.string "{JPN}friend of mine.\p"
	.string "{JPN}Good luck, young {PLAYER}.\n"
	.string "{JPN}I hope you can achieve your dream.$"

	.string "{JPN}We can grow fruit and vegetables\n"
	.string "{JPN}even deep underground this way.\p"
	.string "{JPN}Pretty amazing, right?\p"
	.string "{JPN}But the key is using Pokémon such\n"
	.string "{JPN}as Oddish and Cherubi to help\l"
	.string "{JPN}speed up the growth of our crop.\p"
